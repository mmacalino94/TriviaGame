# Gamer's Trivia Game

## Overview

Using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate the HTML, the challenge was to create a timed Trivia Game. This trivia game has 15 questions and the player is given only 20 seconds to answer each one. Once all of 15 are answered a scoreboard will show how well the player did with the option to redo the trivia game again.


## Inspiration

To continue the general theme of the previous assignment, I went with video games again. I went to look for some fun and interesting trivia facts for my questions. I tried to create a diverse set of questions that encompass the 4 major gaming "consoles":

* Nintendo
* Playstation
* XBox
* PC (I know it's not a console, hence the quotes)

## Technologies Used

* Photoshop (To Create the Header)
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
